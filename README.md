# Weather_Dashboard

## Description
The goal of the project was to make a working weather dashboard using the OpenWeather API. One should be able to look up the weather outlook for different cities. When a city is searched, it should display the current weather and the weather conditions of that city for the next five days. Each city one searches, it is added to a search history. When a city is searched, the city name, date, icon representation of the weather condition, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and uv index is displayed.
